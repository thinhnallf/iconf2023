      The 10th International Conference on Opportunities and Challenges in
      Management, Economics and Accounting follows strict anti-plagiarism
      policies and, as such, checks every submission for plagiarism using
      Crossref Similarity Check Powered by iThenticate. All articles submitted
      to the conference first undergo a plagiarism check before being sent to
      our scientific committee for review. The submission will be automatically
      rejected at any time if found plagiarized. If you’d like to find out more

      Organizing Committee of the conference is working with internationally –
      indexed journals from well-known publishers including SCOPUS, Web of
      Science, DOAJ, and many more. Conference participants will be assisted and
      guided to get their papers published in the Regular Issue or Special
      Issues of these journals. <br />
      Important Note: The decision of whether or not any of the papers can be
      included in the journal publication remains at the full discretion of the
      journal editors and is subject to the results of the double-blind peer
      review and the satisfactory completion of any revisions required.
