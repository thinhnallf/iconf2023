    <h1>POSTER FORMAT</h1>
    <p class="description">
      Design your poster so that it is easy to read and include some visuals or
      charts. Allocate the top of the poster for the title and authorsâ€™ names
      and affiliations. Remember the audience may have a short time frame to
      read your poster. <br />
      The poster size should be A1 international paper size. Materials,
      including the title, should not extend beyond the poster size. Do not use
      foam core or any thick or multi-layered materials or pushpins directly on
      the poster boards. Please make sure that the material used for the poster
      allows it to be posted on the boards. All posters should be based on the
      submitted
